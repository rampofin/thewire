There is a setuid binary in the home directory that does the following: it makes a connection to localhost on the port you specify as a command line argument. 
It then reads a line of text from the connection and compares it to the password in the previous level (bandit20). 
If the password is correct, it will transmit the password for the next level (bandit21).
This one is a little more complicated. Upon entering bandit20â€™s shell, we see a binary that connects to a local port, and waits for a connection and the password to be sent to it from outside.
We need two shells to accomplish this.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
bandit20@bandit:~$ ls
suconnect
bandit20@bandit:~$ ./suconnect
Usage: ./suconnect <portnumber>
This program will connect to the given port on localhost using TCP. If it receives the
correct password from the other side, the next password is transmitted back.
 
#In one shell do:
bandit20@bandit:~$ nc -l 3222
 
#In another shell do:
bandit20@bandit:~$ ls
suconnect
bandit20@bandit:~$ ./suconnect 3222
 
#When the connection is made, go back to the first shell, and paste the password in netcat.
